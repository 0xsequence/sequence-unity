This Sequence Unity SDK features our embedded wallet solution - a smart contract wallet associated with your user's social login or email OTP credentials that supports EVM blockchains, requiring no transaction or signature popups, automatically sponsoring your user's gas fees, and reliably and quickly indexing on-chain data.

The SDK comes equipped with a powerful authentication framework and implementation for Unity and our own purpose-made for Unity Ethereum Library.
