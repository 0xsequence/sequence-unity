These integration tests require a local instance of the server described (and implemented) [here](https://github.com/0xsequence/wallet-contracts-v3). They are useful to confirm that the primitives are working properly. They will run indefinitely and hit the SDK with a variety of random inputs to see if it handles them correctly. Since they run indefinitely, it is best to only run these when interacting with the Sequence.EcosystemWallet.Primitives namespace.
